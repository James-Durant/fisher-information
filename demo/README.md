# Demo
This directory is intended to provide a simplified interface to the simulation and FIM frameworks. To apply the frameworks to your own experimental design problems, simply modify the example models in the following files:
* [angle_choice.py](/demo/angle_choice.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with first and second angle choices for a sample with similar layer SLDs.
* [contrast_choice.py](/demo/contrast_choice.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with first and second contrast choices for an asymmetric bilayer model.
* [underlayer.py](/demo/underlayer.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with underlayer (SiO2) thickness of a DMPC bilayer model.

To run an example, you can call the file from the command line and the output will be saved to the [results](/demo/results) directory.
