# Demonstration
This directory is intended to provide a simplified interface to the simulation and FIM frameworks. To apply the frameworks to your own experimental design problems, simply modify the example models in the given files:
* [angle_choice.py](/demo/angle_choice.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with first and second angle choices.
* [contrast_choice.py](/demo/contrast_choice.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with first and second contrast choices.

To run an example, you can call the file from the command line and the output will be saved to the [results](/demo/results) directory.
