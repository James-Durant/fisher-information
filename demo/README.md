# Demonstration
This directory is intended to provide a simplified interface for simulation and FIM frameworks.

To apply the frameworks to your own experimental design problems, simply modify the example models given in the following files:
* [angle_choice.py](/demo/angle_choice.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with first and second angle choices.
* [contrast_choice.py](/demo/contrast_choice.py) - Investigates how the FIM changes with first and second contrast choices.
* [utils.py](/demo/utils.py) - Contains code for calculating the FIM, simulation and plotting.

To run these examples, you can call the relevant file from the command line. The output of this will be contained in [results](/demo/results).
