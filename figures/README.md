### Figure 2 
The FIM confidence ellipses for k=1,2,3 (red) overlaid on the corner plots of MCMC (black) and nested sampling (blue) for the mostly uncorrelated parameter sample (left) and correlated parameter sample (right). Inset are the SLD profiles (top) and rebinned simulated reflectivity curves (bottom) of the two samples.

### Figure 3
Log FIM uncertainties (top), log fitting uncertainties (middle) and mean absolute error (bottom) vs. log time multiplier for each parameter of the mostly uncorrelated parameter sample (left) and correlated parameter sample (right); the uncertainties are taken as the mean from 10 simulated experiments for a given measurement time multiplier. Included in the legends of the uncertainty time dependence plots are approximations of the gradients of the lines, m, as given by linear regression.

### Figure 4
Fisher information vs. bulk water contrast SLD, for each model parameter of the reparameteristed DMPC bilayer model, for an initial contrast choice (top left) and second contrast choice (bottom left), assuming D2O was measured first. Also shown are the nested sampling corner plots from sampling simulated data of solely D2O (top right), and D2O and H2O contrasts (bottom right). Inset are the fitted SLD profiles (top) and experimental reflectivity curves (bottom) for the Si/D2O interface and the two solution isotopic contrast datasets, H2O and D2O, offset by factors of 10<sup>-2</sup> and 10<sup>-3</sup> respectively for clarity.
